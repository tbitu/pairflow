/**
 * Build handoff guidance with an emit directive that applies uniformly across all agent roles.
 *
 * Lifecycle contract (role-agnostic): the emit directive always applies at the conclusion
 * of an agent's active execution window — i.e., after completing implementation work or a review,
 * but never while idle, waiting for orchestration signals, or in a passive state. This ensures
 * consistent handoff semantics regardless of whether the agent is an implementer (code changes),
 * reviewer (assessment output), or meta-reviewer (structured submit command). The directive uses
 * role-appropriate terminology ("implementation or review session") to avoid confusing agents about
 * when they should emit while maintaining a single underlying lifecycle policy.
